## Key Takeaways

After building this component, you've learned:

1. **Sliding indicators** with `layoutId` create smooth following animations
2. **High stiffness (500)** makes springs feel snappy and responsive
3. **Damping (30)** prevents unwanted oscillation or bounciness
4. **Combine y-offset + blur** for elegant content transitions
5. **AnimatePresence with mode="wait"** ensures clean exit/enter sequences
6. **Always support reduced motion** with `useReducedMotion()` from Motion
