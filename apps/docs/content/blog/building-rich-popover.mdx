## Key Takeaways

After building this component, you've learned:

1. **Scale + opacity + blur** creates a "materializing" effect
2. **Blur transitions** mimic how our eyes focus on appearing content
3. **Spring physics** with high stiffness (500) feel more responsive than easings
4. **Dark themes** benefit from subtle white borders with transparency
5. **Rich content structure** (icon + title + description + meta + action) creates visual hierarchy
6. **Always support reduced motion** - instant transitions are still accessible
