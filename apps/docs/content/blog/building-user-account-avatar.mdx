## Key Takeaways

After building this component, you've learned:

1. **Spring animations** with `bounce: 0-0.1` feel professional and natural
2. **Keep durations under 300ms** for responsive UI
3. **Combine opacity + height + blur** for polished expand/collapse effects
4. **Always support reduced motion** with `useReducedMotion()` from Motion
5. **Use Radix primitives** for built-in accessibility
6. **Test with keyboard** and screen readers
