# Blocks

SmoothUI Blocks are complete, ready-to-use page sections that you can copy and customize. Unlike components, blocks are larger UI patterns that combine multiple elements to create full sections of a page.

## What are Blocks?

Blocks are pre-built sections like headers, footers, hero sections, feature grids, and more. Each block is a complete, production-ready example that you can:

- Copy directly into your project
- Customize with your own content
- Modify styles and animations
- Combine with other blocks or components

## Block Categories

### Header Blocks

Navigation headers with various styles and mobile menu support:

- **Header 1** - Modern header with mobile menu and smooth animations
- **Header 2** - Premium header with gradient logo and hover effects

## Features

- **Responsive** - All blocks work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Customizable** - Easy to modify colors, spacing, and content

## Using Blocks

Blocks are located in `packages/smoothui/blocks/`. Each block is a complete React component that you can:

1. **Copy the code** directly into your project
2. **Import and use** as a standalone component
3. **Customize** to match your brand and needs
