## Motion & GSAP-Powered React Components

SmoothUI provides a comprehensive collection of **animated React components** powered by [Motion](https://motion.dev) (formerly Framer Motion) and [GSAP](https://gsap.com). Every component is designed with smooth, performant animations that enhance user experience without sacrificing accessibility.

## Animation Categories

### Text Animations

Create engaging text effects that capture attention:

| Component | Animation Type | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Typewriter Text](/docs/components/typewriter-text) | Character reveal | Hero sections, AI interfaces |

| [Wave Text](/docs/components/wave-text) | Wave motion | Decorative headings |
| [Reveal Text](/docs/components/reveal-text) | Directional reveal | Page transitions |

### Interactive Cards

Cards with smooth expand, hover, and transition animations:

| Component | Animation Type | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Expandable Cards](/docs/components/expandable-cards) | Layout animation | Portfolios, galleries |
| [Glow Hover Card](/docs/components/glow-hover-card) | Cursor-following glow | Feature highlights |
| [Scrollable Card Stack](/docs/components/scrollable-card-stack) | Parallax reveal | Testimonials, profiles |

### Button Animations

Buttons with satisfying micro-interactions:

| Component | Animation Type | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Magnetic Button](/docs/components/magnetic-button) | Cursor attraction | CTAs, navigation |
| [Button Copy](/docs/components/button-copy) | Success feedback | Code snippets |
| [Clip Corners Button](/docs/components/clip-corners-button) | Corner animation | Unique CTAs |

### Form Inputs

Inputs with smooth focus and validation animations:

| Component | Animation Type | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Animated Input](/docs/components/animated-input) | Floating label | Forms, search |
| [Animated OTP Input](/docs/components/animated-otp-input) | Digit animation | Verification flows |

### Notification Components

Animated feedback and notification elements:

| Component | Animation Type | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Dynamic Island](/docs/components/dynamic-island) | Expand/collapse | Notifications, status |
| [Basic Toast](/docs/components/basic-toast) | Slide animation | Alerts, confirmations |

## Why Motion & GSAP?

### Performance Optimized

All animations use GPU-accelerated transforms (`transform` and `opacity`) for smooth 60fps performance. No layout thrashing or paint operations.

### Accessibility First

Every component respects the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. Users who are sensitive to motion see instant transitions instead of animations.

```tsx
// Built into every component
const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();
```

### Natural Feel

Animations use spring physics with carefully tuned parameters for natural, fluid motion that feels right:

```tsx
transition={{
  type: "spring",
  duration: 0.25,
  bounce: 0.1
}}
```

## Getting Started

Install any animated component using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @smoothui/expandable-cards
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
<Accordion id="motion-required" title="Do I need to know Motion or GSAP?">
  No! All animations are built-in and work out of the box. You can use components without writing any animation code. For customization, basic Motion or GSAP knowledge helps but isn't required.
</Accordion>
<Accordion id="bundle-size" title="How do animations affect bundle size?">
  Motion and GSAP are the animation dependencies. Components are tree-shakeable, so you only ship the code you use. Most components use Motion, while some use GSAP for advanced effects like the Gooey Popover.
</Accordion>
<Accordion id="ssr-support" title="Do animations work with Next.js SSR?">
  Yes! All components are designed for Next.js App Router and work with Server Components. Client-side animations hydrate smoothly without layout shift.
</Accordion>
<Accordion id="custom-animations" title="Can I customize the animations?">
  Absolutely. Since you own the code (copied into your project), you can modify any animation parameters - duration, easing, spring physics, and more.
