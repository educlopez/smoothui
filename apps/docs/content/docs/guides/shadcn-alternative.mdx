## The Best of Both Worlds

SmoothUI isn't a replacement for shadcn/ui - it's the perfect companion. While shadcn/ui excels at providing solid, accessible base components, SmoothUI extends the ecosystem with **animated, interactive components** that bring your interfaces to life.

<div className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">

## Why Choose SmoothUI?

### Smooth Motion Animations

Every SmoothUI component is built with **[Motion](https://motion.dev)** and **[GSAP](https://gsap.com)** animations that feel natural and polished. No more wrestling with CSS keyframes or animation libraries - animations are built-in and optimized for performance.

```tsx
// Just import and use - animations included
import { ExpandableCards } from "@/components/ui/expandable-cards"

<ExpandableCards items={cards} />
```

### Same Workflow, Added Motion

If you're familiar with shadcn/ui, you'll feel right at home. SmoothUI uses the **same CLI installation pattern**:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @smoothui/expandable-cards
```

Components are copied into your project, giving you full ownership and customization control.

### Built for Modern React

SmoothUI components follow React best practices:

- **Server Components compatible** - Works with Next.js App Router
- **TypeScript first** - Full type definitions included
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Uses the latest Tailwind features
- **Accessibility** - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | shadcn/ui | SmoothUI |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Static Components | Excellent | Good |
| Animated Components | Limited | Excellent |
| Motion Animations | Manual setup | Built-in |
| Installation | shadcn CLI | shadcn CLI |
| Customization | Full control | Full control |
| TypeScript | Yes | Yes |
| Tailwind CSS | v3/v4 | v4 |
| Dark Mode | Yes | Yes |
| Accessibility | Excellent | Good |
| Component Count | 40+ | 50+ |

## When to Use Each

### Use shadcn/ui for:
- Form inputs, selects, and form validation
- Modal dialogs and alert dialogs
- Navigation menus and dropdowns
- Data tables and pagination
- Basic buttons and badges

### Use SmoothUI for:
- Animated card layouts and expandable cards
- Smooth hover effects and micro-interactions
- Dynamic content transitions
- Interactive showcases and galleries
- Animated text effects (typewriter, wave, scramble)
- Loading states with motion

## Working Together

The best approach is using both libraries together. Here's a typical setup:

```tsx
// shadcn/ui for the form structure
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog"

// SmoothUI for animated elements
import { AnimatedInput } from "@/components/ui/animated-input"
import { ScrambleHover } from "@/components/ui/scramble-hover"
import { ExpandableCards } from "@/components/ui/expandable-cards"
```

Both libraries use the same folder structure (`components/ui/`) and Tailwind CSS foundation, making them seamlessly compatible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
<Accordion id="replace-shadcn" title="Do I need to replace shadcn/ui with SmoothUI?">
  No! SmoothUI is designed to complement shadcn/ui, not replace it. Use shadcn/ui for forms and foundational UI, and add SmoothUI components when you need animations and interactivity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion id="same-project" title="Can I use both in the same project?">
  Absolutely! Both libraries use the same installation pattern and folder structure. They work together seamlessly in the same project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion id="learning-curve" title="Is there a learning curve if I know shadcn/ui?">
  Minimal. If you're familiar with shadcn/ui, you already know the workflow. SmoothUI components follow the same patterns - just with added animations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion id="performance" title="Do animations affect performance?">
  SmoothUI animations are built with Motion and GSAP, optimized for performance. They use GPU-accelerated transforms and respect the user's reduced motion preferences for accessibility.
